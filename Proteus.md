[Proteus Manual](Proteus-Manual)


Q: where can I buy a Proteus?

A: https://www.ebay.com/itm/333811680319

With fabrication files for Proteus you can get a 80% assembled unit from JLCPCB. QTY 2 price XXX, QTY 10 price YYY.
While the most complicated main chip is soldered you would still solder a few dozens of surface mount components.

## Dev Access

Most boards will need a debug header installed if you want to attach a debugger (not used for normal users).  The recommended connector is Samtec PN `FTSH-105-01-F-DV-007-K`.  When soldering the connector, the keying notch goes towards the center of the board, nearer to the 23p center connector.

Any debugger compatible with the standard 10-pin Cortex Debug Header should work, though the [STLINK-V3 Mini](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stlink-v3mini.html) is recommmended.  It's available for $10-12 US from normal distributors like Mouser/Digikey.  A ribbon cable is included so the connector and programmer are all that's required to debug on Proteus.
